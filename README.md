# R Real Estate SF and WA

This R project used this [Zillow Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zillow/rent-index). Various libraries were used to display the data, most noteably ggplot and ggmap. The above graph shows the average increase in rent price over the course of seven years.

To replicate the results use [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com) and open Zillow.R. The code is commented at each step to aid understanding.

# Results

### Graph 1: WA Counties - Growth

![WA img](https://github.com/mleegina/R-real-estate/blob/master/Graphs/wa.png)
  This hows the greatest increase in price over the course of 7 years. 
  My hometown is one of the ones in red, and I have seen enormous growth.

### Graph 2: US PPSQ

  This shows the average price per square foot by county, by year, in the US. 
  I turned it into a gif for fun to see the change. Next time I would choose a 
  smaller area in order to better see the changes.

### Graph 3: SF Home Price

  This shows homes near the Presidio, SoMa, Nob Hill, Russian Hill, and North 
  Beach selling at a lot higher price in 2015 than in 2009.

### Graph 4: SF Evictions

  Lots of evictions near the Nob Hill, Russian Hill, and downtown area in 2003-2012. 
  You can see from graph 3 that those are the areas with the highest home prices.
  This would be more accurate if I had rental data for SF neighborhoods, 
  and foreclosure data.
