Next time I would choose a \n  smaller area in order to better see the changes. CO, FL, OR are heating up\nGraph 3: SF Home Price\n  This shows homes near the presidio, soma, nob hill, russian hill, and north \n  beach selling at a lot higher price in 2015 than in 2009.\nGraph 4: SF Evictions\n  Lots of evictions near the nob hill, russian hill, downtown area 2003-2012. \n  You can see from graph 3 that those are the areas with the highest home prices.\n  This would be more accurate if I had rental data for SF neighborhoods, \n  and forclosure data.\n\nI had a lot of fun with this lab, I am interested in real estate and it was pretty \ncool to see that I could do some analysis given a public dataset. After living in SF \nfor the summer and seeing gentrification happen first hand in Seattle, I've been closely \nfollowing the topic. After talking to Prof Plotka, I got permission to change the \nnetworking lab to a geograpic lab. \n\nhttp://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2017/08/29/546980178/what-does-it-take-to-see-gentrification-before-it-happens\n\nI remembered that this article stated that evictions could be used as a way to predict \ngentrification. Eviction records are hard to get a hold of because you need to go to the \ncity court and they are not officially recorded by the census. I believe they are going to \nstart recording evictions on the census. Another way to predict gentrification is by \nlooking to see how many school closures were in the area. I want to explore that as well \nwhen I have more time.\n\nSome limitations were the datasets that were available, often I could only find complete \nsets of data for certain cities. \n",
